Currently available Multiple-Object Tracking (MOT)
systems either follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm,
in which object detection, feature extraction, and data association are all performed separately, or combine two of
the three phases.In this paper, we propose an end-to-end online MOT model, that takes two adjacent frames as its input,
combining the object detection, feature representation, and
data association into a simple paired bounding boxes regression problem. An joint attention module is introduced to
highlight informative regions for the paired bounding boxes
regression. State-of-the-art performances have been obtained on the most widely used public benchmark datasets.
